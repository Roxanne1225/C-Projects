Today is a special day for Taylor Swift. Because she does not have any works to do and she could enjoy herself, relaxing for the whole day. After getting up in the morning, she watches the clock which shows 11:30 am. At this time, she has two different choices. The first one is stay in the bed, and the next one is get up and have "breakfast".
